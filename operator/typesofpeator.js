/* 
1)associativity (l to r ,r to l): when same operator or same precidency operaotors come in an expression then this rule will applied
2)precidacy : when an expression have multiple operator
3)operands type: all operators works on fix operand types
4)number of operands :
    ->unary (++,--,~,!)
    ->binary 
    ->ternay (?:)

arithmatical ( + - * /  % **)
assignment  (= ,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,**=)
Relational/comparision (==,===(identical),>=,<=,!=,!==,>,<)
increment and decrement (++,--)
logical (&&,||,!)
conditional(?:, ??)
bitwise (<< >> & | ^ ~ )
typeof

*Note: 
    Most of all binary operators work on left to right 
        excepts: = , ** (r to l) 
    Most of all unary operators work on right to left 
        excepts: ++a ,--a (l to r)
